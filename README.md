## User Stories

After missing my train by quite literally one second, I was devastated to see that the next one arrives in 10 MTA minutes. Thatâ€™s like half an hour in real life! So to pass the time, I decided to play the first silly app I ran into in the app store, which just so happened to be Kwiz. The aesthetically pleasing interface captured my interest immediately, and I was surprised to find myself unable to blow through the challenges without much thought. I was very engaged by the fact that my initial thought was never the correct approach; I always had to reassess the way I was thinking and really get my gears turning before I could figure out the right way to overcome a challenge. If it wasn't for the 15 minute wait to recover your lives once you've failed the Kwiz, I would've been so consumed by getting through this stupid game that I would've missed the train again!

## Prototype Features
The user will log in

The user will have three lives available

The user is presented with the first question/ prompt. When the user solves this question they will move on to the next question/prompt

For example the question will ask the user to find the smallest circle on the screen and the user will look for it and click it then the view will change to the next question. If they click the wrong circle they would lose a life and if they lose all three lives then they would have to start all over again. There will be a scoring function based on question solved and if maybe the user wins at the end we will give him a certificate he can brag to his friends about.
- The user prompted to select a specific spot on screen or answer/button
- The user draws an answer maybe?
- Unique Questions with equally unique answers
- Drag and drop
- Score leaderboard

Questions/prompts will be humorous and challenging
If the user is stuck, they can choose the option of receiving a hint. There will only be one hint available per game
If the user fails to correctly answer a question/prompt, they lose a life
Once all lives are lost, the user is brought back to the very first question and the lives are replenished.
After the completion of every game, the user is given a score (calculated from how many lives lost / hint used) and a ranking based on that score, to promote competition between friends
